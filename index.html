        </u>
        An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or
        in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss,
        poaching and invasive species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the
        global conservation status of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within
        particular areas. Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid
        hunting, restrict land development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of
        extensive conservation efforts such as captive breeding and habitat restoration.

        </u>
        <p>
            The conservation status of a species indicates the likelihood that it will become extinct. Many factors are
            considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the
            overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.[2] The
            IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking
            system.[3] Over 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction.[4] Internationally,
            195 countries have signed an accord to create Biodiversity Action Plans that will protect endangered and
            other threatened species. In the United States, such plans are usually called Species Recovery Plans

        <p>
            Though labeled a list, the IUCN Red List is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species
            that includes "Data Deficient" (DD) species – species for which more data and assessment is required before
            their situation may be determined – as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species
            assessment process. Those species of "Near Threatened" (NT) and "Least Concern" (LC) status have been
            assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike
            their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms "endangered species" and "threatened species" with
            particular meanings: "Endangered" (EN) species lie between "Vulnerable" (VU) and "Critically Endangered"
            (CR) species. In 2012, the IUCN Red List listed 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered (EN)
            worldwide.

            <p class="text-small">
                The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), also known as the Asiatic elephant, is the only living species of
                the genus Elephas and is distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India
                in the west, Nepal in the north, Sumatra in the south, and to Borneo in the east. Three subspecies are
                recognised—E. m. maximus from Sri Lanka, E. m. indicus from mainland Asia and E. m. sumatranus from the
                island of Sumatra.

                The Asian elephant is the largest living land animal in Asia.Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been
                listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as the population has declined by at least 50 percent over
                the last three elephant generations, which is about 60–75 years. It is primarily threatened by loss of
                habitat, habitat degradation, fragmentation and poaching.In 2003, the wild population was estimated at
                between 41,410 and 52,345 individuals. Female captive elephants have lived beyond 60 years when kept in
                semi-natural surroundings, such as forest camps. In zoos, Asian elephants die at a much younger age;
                captive populations are declining due to a low birth and high death rate.

            <hr>
            <p class="text-small">
                Scientific Name: Balaenoptera musculus<br>
                Status: Endangered<br>
                Number Remaining: 10,000 to 25,000<br>
                Average Length: 30 metre long<br>
                Average Weight: about 190 tons<br>
                Region Found: Indian Ocean<br>

                The blue whale is the largest animal on our planet. It weighs as much as 33 elephants, are as long about
                three school buses, has a heart the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, and it must eat around 4 tons of krill
                per day! They have been found in every ocean.

                These gigantic creatures were almost whaled into extinction until they were declared protected by the
                International Whaling Commission in 1966. While whaling is no longer considered a major threat for the
                whale species, they are still threatened by climate change as it affects their main prey, krill. They're
                also majorly affected by pollution.

                Blue whales were once abundant around the world. In the nineteenth century, they were hunted almost to
                extinction by whalers. They were finally protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report
                estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, located in at least five groups. More recent
                research into the Pygmy subspecies suggests this may be an underestimate. Before whaling, the largest
                population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There
                remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic,
                and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, and at least two in the
                Southern Hemisphere.

                Region Found: Freshwater rivers<br>


                The Ganges river dolphin was officially discovered in 1801. Ganges river dolphins once lived in the
                Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. But the
                species is extinct from most of its early distribution ranges.

                The Ganges river dolphin can only live in freshwater and is essentially blind. They hunt by emitting
                ultrasonic sounds, which bounces off of fish and other prey, enabling them to “see” an image in their
                mind. They are frequently found alone or in small groups, and generally a mother and calf travel
                together. Calves are chocolate brown at birth and then have grey-brown smooth, hairless skin as adults.
                Females are larger than males and give birth once every two to three years to only one calf.
                The Gangetic dolphin is the most threatened cetacean and among the world's most threatened mammals. It
                is listed as an endangered species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red Book
                and as a Flagship Species by WWF. It is placed in Schedule-I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

                Often confused with California Sea Lions, Stellar Sea Lions are much larger in lighter in color. In
                order to properly track populations, Stellar Sea Lions are broken up into two groups: The Western U.S.
                and the Eastern U.S. Currently, it appears that the Eastern population has been growing steadily over
                the last few years, but the Western population has been decreasing at about a 5 percent rate. The
                largest threats to these animals are: boat/ship strikes, pollutants, habitat degradation, and illegal
                hunting/shooting.

                Sea lions are pinnipeds characterized by external ear flaps, long foreflippers, the ability to walk on
                all fours, short, thick hair, and a big chest and belly. Together with the fur seals, they comprise the
                family Otariidae, eared seals, which contains six extant and one extinct species (the Japanese sea lion)
                in five genera. Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both
                the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the notable exception of the northern Atlantic Ocean.They
                have an average lifespan of 20–30 years.

            <p class="text-small">
                The chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), also known as the common chimpanzee, robust chimpanzee, or simply chimp, is a species of great ape native to the forest and savannah of tropical Africa. It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo (sometimes called the "pygmy chimpanzee") are classified in the genus Pan. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that Pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is humans' closest living relative.

                The chimpanzee is listed on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as chimpanzees' tea parties, circus acts and stage shows. They are sometimes kept as pets, though their strength and aggressiveness makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in America. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as American Sign Language to chimpanzees, with limited success.

                The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the green turtle, black (sea) turtle or Pacific green turtle,is a species of large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae. It is the only species in the genus Chelonia.Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but it is also found in the Indian Ocean.The common name refers to the usually green fat found beneath its carapace, not to the color of its carapace, which is olive to black.
                C. mydas is listed as endangered by the IUCN and CITES and is protected from exploitation in most countries.[8] It is illegal to collect, harm or kill them. In addition, many countries have laws and ordinances to protect nesting areas. However, turtles are still in danger due to human activity. In some countries, turtles and their eggs are hunted for food. Pollution indirectly harms turtles at both population and individual scales, as well as light pollution. Many turtles die after being caught in fishing nets. Also, real estate development often causes habitat loss by eliminating nesting beaches.

                The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

                The tiger is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small pockets isolated from each other. India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, in particular in range countries with a high human population density.
